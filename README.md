# Cool Compiler

A compiler for the Cool (Classroom Object Oriented Language) language done as a term project for a Compiler Design Course.

## Repo Organization

Each directory in the repo corresponds to an assignment submission and each part of the compiler.

* PA1 is a stack machine example program written with Cool
* The Compiler:
  * PA2 is the lexer written with Flex
  * PA3 is the parser written with Bison
  * PA4 is the semantic analyzer
  * PA5 is the code generator written in the MIPS instruction set

* Note: PA2, 3, and 5 passed all of the course's test cases and performed nearly identically to the reference compiler implementation. PA4 correctly analyzed correct Cool programs but did not pass all of the test cases.
